## Adding Something to the List
If you have something awesome to contribute to an awesome list, this is how you do it.

### Some Notes
- You should open a pull request for the README.md file against the `master` branch. 
- Use the [Pull Request Template](pull_request_template.md) (its simple and should load automatically).
- Follow the format laid out in the README. Use the tags correctly. View the readme to see what the github flavored tags are.
- Curate, don't collect. You must verify that you have first hand experience with what you are proposing and that it is of high quality. 
- First party owners of material are discouraged from submitting, but will not be automatically turned down.

### Updating your PR
A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
